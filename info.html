                <p class="wow zoomIn">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;London has an extensive and developed transport network which includes both private and public services. Journeys made by public transport systems account for 37% of London's journeys while private services accounted for 36% of journeys. London's public transport network serves as the central hub for the United Kingdom in rail, air and road transport.<br><br>
                Colloquially known as the Tube, the London Underground was the first rapid transit system in the world, having begun operations in 1863. More than 3 million passengers travel on the Underground every day, amounting to over 1 billion passenger journeys per year for the first time in 2006. The Underground has 11 lines, most of which connect the suburbs to Central London and together form a dense network in central London, linking major railway stations, central business areas and icons. The Underground serves North London much more extensively than South London. This is the result of a combination of unfavourable geology, historical competition from surface railways and the historical geography of London which was focused to the north of the River Thames. South London is served primarily by surface railways (although it should be noted that the majority of London Underground's route length is actually on the surface rather than in tunnel.)</p>

                   <span>Summer weather</span>
                    Summer can be very pleasant with temperatures averaging 18°C (64°F) and often into the low 20s. In recent years London has experienced heatwaves with temperatures well above 30°C (86°F). This is an ideal time to visit London's parks and open spaces or have a go at swimming and boating in London.

                    <span>Spring and autumn weather</span>
                    Spring and autumn see temperatures of around 11° to 15°C (52 to 59°F). Evenings are lighter for longer with the advent of British Summer Time at the end of March (until end October). For details of the many festivals and events during these months, check out our London events calendar.

                    <span>Winter weather</span>
                    Typical temperatures for winter are between 2 and 10°C (35 and 50°F). Temperatures don't often drop below freezing and snow isn't common – although occasionally London does experience heavy snowfall and an army of snowmen pop up all over the city! Don't miss the stunning Christmas decorations in London or the famous New Year's Eve fireworks.</p>

               <span>Coach</span>
                <p class="wow zoomIn">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coach transfers to and from the airport are really good value for money, with National Express services starting from £5 one-way when booked in advance. Coaches run 24-hours a day, are air-conditioned and many offer free wifi.

                Easybus offer services between Gatwick, Stansted and Luton airports and central London drop-off points, with fares staring as low as £2 one way when booked in advance.

                Greenline coaches also run services from Heathrow, Luton and Stansted airports to a wide range of central London locations.
                <br><span>Train</span> 
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;London Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports each have dedicated express train services running regularly to Central London stations.

                The Heathrow Express runs every 15 minutes between London Paddington station and all five Heathrow terminals. Fares start at £21 one-way. Heathrow Connect services run from London Paddington to Heathrow Central (Terminals 1, 2 and 3). Journey time is about 25 minutes. 

                The Gatwick Express runs between London Victoria and the South Terminal train station every 15 minutes. Fares start at £17.75 when booked in advance online.

                <p class="last-p wow zoomIn">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The official currency of the United Kingdom is the pound sterling, known as the pound (£, GBP). Each pound is divided into 100 pence (100p = £1).
                The most common banknotes are £5, £10, £20, £50 and £100. £1 notes also exist, but these are extremely rare, as only notes printed by The Bank of Scotland remain in circulation, and printing of new £1 notes ceased in 2001.

The coins in circulation are 1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p and £1 and £2. Sometimes, special editions of £5 coins are released, but their circulation is merely theoretical</p></div>
